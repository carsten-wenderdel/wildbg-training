# wildbg-training

This repository documents the training process of [wildb](https://github.com/carsten-wenderdel/wildbg).

Each folder contains a rollout data and the neural net that was trained on that data.
The first rollout happened with random moves. The second rollout used the first net for evaluating moves etc.
